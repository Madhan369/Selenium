TestNG
---------------
TestNG is a unit testing next generation tool.
> it will be used for the following reasons
 - cross browser testing.
 - run same test script any number Of times.
 - parallel execution.
 - data driven testing.
 - emailable test execution report.
 - batch execution.
 - we can run test scripts according to the test plan.
---------------------------------
one testcase - one script - one method.
one class - one module/build.
----------------------------
In Java there are 4 templates as follows:
> Class > Interface > Enumeration > Annotation
Annotations - It is the java template and also it is the represenation of the logic.
- In testNG there are lot of annotations which can be used to run the scripts.

-----------------------
What is testNG Class?
How to create testNG Class?
How @Test Annotation will work?
--------------------------
> priority - @Test
 - default value is 0
 - it will set the order of execution.
> enabled - @Test
  - default value boolean true.
  - it will help us to the stop the @Test annotation annotated method from the execution.
> invocationCount - @Test
  - default value - 1
 - it will help us to execute the same test script any number of times.
